## Antergos back to English

Once choosing other than English location, even though we choose English during installation, Antergos will subsequently start in auto-detected language, based on initially chosen location. If you prefer to switch it back to English just do the following:

```sh
sudo vim /etc/locale.gen
# ucomment: en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8

sudo locale-gen
localectl set-locale LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
locale -a
localectl list-locales
```

Re-login, tada! It's done :)
